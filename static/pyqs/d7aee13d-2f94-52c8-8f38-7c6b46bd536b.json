While &quot;barbarous&quot; certainly includes a negative connotation, it specifically refers to a lack of civilization or brutal behavior. So, while a &quot;barbarous&quot; act is generally &quot;bad,&quot; these words are not direct opposites. </p>\n<p><b>Option B : &quot;Good&quot; -</b> This is a general term used to express approval or positive qualities in something.

It also can refer to behavior that is polite, refined, and respectful of others. In other words, &quot;civilised&quot; behavior is the opposite of &quot;barbarous&quot; behavior, which is often characterized by brutality, violence, and lack of advanced cultural and social systems.</p>\n<p><b>Option D : &quot;Exemplary&quot; -</b> This word is used to describe something that is a desirable model or very good example of a particular quality. Although &quot;exemplary&quot; could imply behavior that is the opposite of &quot;barbarous,&quot; it doesn&#39;t necessarily contrast the uncivilized or brutal connotations of &quot;barbarous&quot; in the same direct way as &quot;civilised.&quot; It&#39;s more about being a good example, which can encompass many behaviors beyond just the opposite of being barbarous. </p>\n<p>Hence, out of all the options, &quot;civilised&quot; is the closest to being the opposite of &quot;barbarous&quot;.</p>"},{"question_id":"1l131cruo","chapter":"vocabulary","chapterGroup":null,"difficulty":null,"marks":3,"negMarks":1,"subject":"english-proficiency","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"direction":"<p>In the following question, out of the four alternatives, choose the one which can be substituted for the given words/sentence.</p>","content":"<p>A person who does not believe in any religion</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"Philatelist"},{"identifier":"B","content":"Rationalist"},{"identifier":"C","content":"Atheist"},{"identifier":"D","content":"Pagan"}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":"<p><b>Option C :</b>\n<br/><br/>Atheist</p>\n<p>Explanation :</p>\n<p>The term &#39;Atheist&#39; specifically refers to a person who does not believe in the existence of a god or any gods, and by extension, does not subscribe to any religion.

Some rationalists might also subscribe to religious beliefs.</p>\n<p><b>Option D : Pagan -</b> Pagans are typically characterized as people holding religious beliefs other than those of the main world religions, rather than not believing in any religion.
